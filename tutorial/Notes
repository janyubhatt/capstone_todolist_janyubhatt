Notes From HTML Dog:

HTML{
HTML is structured by tags <tag></tag>
usually they have end tags aswell although some tags close themselves ex <link/>...
Some tags have attributes, which provide more info. They are always inside the tag, after the tag name, and their values 
are in quotation marks
the <a> tag creates a link that opens a new window/tab. This isn't preferred because it hurts usability since
the  navigation is interrupted-back button isn't able to be used. Also, users don't want windows all over the place

}

CSS{

colors are defined by :
    name, rgb (rrr,ggg,bbb), rgb(r%,g%,b%), hex-#FFEE11, hex-FE1 (shorter version of hex)
Different ways to define sizes and lenghts:
    em (calculated current font size), px (pixels), %, pt (points), other metrics (mm,cm,in)
Web page should not be static and users should be able to view page as they like it. 
    Recommended to use em and % rather than px because px is fixed and allows no variability

        Dynamic Bargain: an agreement that you make with yourself to assess what yo've accomplished and what you more you 
        want to accomplish from time to time throughout the day, adjusting to new conditions as they emerge. 
            -ex: what would it take for me to feel good about ending work on time today?
        It is important to feel good about getting work done-if tasks are constantly added to your list, the sense of completion and 
        satisfaction will not occur-and that is very important.
