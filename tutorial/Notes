Notes From HTML Dog:

HTML{
HTML is structured by tags <tag></tag>
usually they have end tags aswell although some tags close themselves ex <link/>...
Some tags have attributes, which provide more info. They are always inside the tag, after the tag name, and their values 
are in quotation marks
the <a> tag creates a link that opens a new window/tab. This isn't preferred because it hurts usability since
the  navigation is interrupted-back button isn't able to be used. Also, users don't want windows all over the place

}

CSS{

colors are defined by :
    name, rgb (rrr,ggg,bbb), rgb(r%,g%,b%), hex-#FFEE11, hex-FE1 (shorter version of hex)
Different ways to define sizes and lenghts:
    em (calculated current font size), px (pixels), %, pt (points), other metrics (mm,cm,in)
Web page should not be static and users should be able to view page as they like it. 
    Recommended to use em and % rather than px because px is fixed and allows no variability
    
Font-family=actual font (times new roman, arial...)
    the font specified must be on the users computer, so should not use strange, obscure fonts
    it is possible to indicate multiple fonts too, seperated by commas. The first font indicated is the preferref font to use,
    and the second one is used if the first is not available and so on...
    for example, //font-color: arial, helvetica // is common because arial is found on most pc's but not helvetica, and 
    helvetica is found on most macs, but not arial
    if the font is multiple words, use quotations: "times new roman"
Other font font properties:  font-size, font-weight, font-decoration
font-size text such as headings should not be paragraphs with really arge font-use h1...tags, but just adjust font size to your needs
    be judicial with font size
font weight indicates whether the font is bold or not.
    ususally it works like//font-weight: bold or font-weight:normal
    the full possibilities are: lighter, 100,200,300..900, but browsers usually prefer just bold or normal
font style is italic or normal
font decoration means underine or not
    it can be none, overline, line-through, and underline
    usually shouldn't underline things since people expect underlined words to be links, and this property is normally used
    to decorate links-ex, saying font-decoration: none, to make links not underlined.
text-transform will change the case of the font
    capitalize(first letter of each word capital), uppercase, lowercase, none
Text spacing: letter-spacing or word-spacing are used for space betweeen the text. Their values can be a lenght or 'normal'
    line-height sets the height of the lines without affecting font. It can bea number(which is a multiple of font size), a length, a percentage, or normal
    text-align can be right,center,left,justify
    text-indent specifies the first line of paragraphs, to the specified length or percent.    

The box method consists of the margin,the border, the padding, and the element.
The individual settings of these properities for the four sides can be set like this: margin-top:....

        Dynamic Bargain: an agreement that you make with yourself to assess what yo've accomplished and what you more you 
        want to accomplish from time to time throughout the day, adjusting to new conditions as they emerge. 
            -ex: what would it take for me to feel good about ending work on time today?
        It is important to feel good about getting work done-if tasks are constantly added to your list, the sense of completion and 
        satisfaction will not occur-and that is very important.
