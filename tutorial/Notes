Notes From HTML Dog:

HTML{


}

CSS{

colors are defined by :
    name, rgb (rrr,ggg,bbb), rgb(r%,g%,b%), hex-#FFEE11, hex-FE1 (shorter version of hex)
Different ways to define sizes and lenghts:
    em (calculated current font size), px (pixels), %, pt (points), other metrics (mm,cm,in)
Web page should not be static and users should be able to view page as they like it. 
    Recommended to use em and % rather than px because px is fixed and allows no variability
